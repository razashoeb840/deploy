## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide

Follow these simple steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Local instance or MongoDB Atlas account)

### 1. Clone the Repository
*(Note: Skip this step if you already have the source code locally)*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/razashoeb840/MediPulse.git
cd MediPulse
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
npm install
```
*(This installs Express, Mongoose, Socket.io, Cors, and Dotenv).*

### 3. Environment Configuration
The project uses `dotenv` for environment variables. The database connection is already configured in `server.js`, but you can override it by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_custom_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 4. Database Seeding (Optional)
To populate the database with initial dummy data (medicines, staff, etc.) for testing:
```bash
node seed.js
```

### 5. Start the Server
Start the Express backend server:
```bash
npm start
```
*You should see a message confirming: `Server running on port 5000` and `MongoDB Connected`.*

### 6. Access the Application
Open your preferred web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

- `GET /api/admin/staff` - Retrieves all registered hospital staff (Doctors, Receptionists, etc.).
- `POST /api/admin/register-staff` - Registers a new doctor or staff member and generates a unique ID.
- `DELETE /api/admin/staff/:id` - Removes a staff member from the system.
- `PUT /api/doctors/:id/active` - Toggles the real-time availability status of a doctor.

### Patient & Queue Management
- `POST /api/patients/register` - Registers a new patient, assigns a doctor, and generates a queue token.
- `GET /api/patients/queue` - Fetches the current active patient queue.
- `GET /api/patients/history` - Retrieves all past patient records and consultation histories.
- `PUT /api/patients/:id/status` - Updates patient lifecycle status (e.g., waiting, prescribed, completed).

## 💡 Usage Workflow Example
1. **Admin** logs in, registers a new Doctor, and monitors hospital stats.
2. **Receptionist** registers a patient and assigns them to the newly created Doctor.
3. **Patient** waits; their token updates live on the Patient Portal.
4. **Doctor** sees the patient in their queue, conducts the checkup, and submits a digital prescription.
5. **Pharmacist** receives the prescription instantly in the Pharmacy module and processes the final billing.
